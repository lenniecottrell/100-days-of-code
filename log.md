### Day 1: January 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started building the UI for my flashcard app

**Thoughts:** Progress is always slower than I want it to be, but I'm committing to 100days of code so that I'll get better!

### Day 2: January 5, 2021

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Got the basic UI layout almost finished for my #React flashcard app today. Learned a lot about #CSS flexbox trying to work this out. Still a lot of styling to do, but happy with today's _very slow_ progres

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot more about CSS from this one day than I did on my bootcamp :(

### Day 2.5: January 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent a distracted hour fixing layout issues on my flash card before the American capital was stormed by domestic terrorists. I also finished the basic CSS module of freeCodeCamp as a review.

**Thoughts** I finally learned about CSS variables today!

### Day 3: January 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I built my first REST API today using node/express/postgreSQL. Felt good to do something that I see on so many job postings. Not so scary anymore!

**Thoughts** : Tech I don't know is always scary until I start trying to learn it.

### Day 4: January 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent the whole time debugging a CORS issue, and then found out Postgres wonâ€™t connect anymore. Looks like I have a lot of troubleshooting to do in the next few days

**Thoughts** : These types of problems are SO FRUSTRATING because my progress was going great and all of a sudden my tools stopped working. Arg!!!
